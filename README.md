# Cracking Cichlid Code: A Genome Assembly Workflow
From June 2024 to early 2025, I had the wonderful opportunity to work with the Kocher Biology Lab where they focus on evolutionary traits and patterns in cichlids (fish!). I worked under Professor Tom Kocher and my mentor Kristen Behrens as we wrapped up the lab's final projects. My main contribution was genome assembly, so I want to showcase the process and some of the scripts I was able to write to automate certain steps in the workflow.
